		<p>Bangladesh is the most beautiful country of south Asia loaded with natural beauties and historical establishments. It has it’s two thousand years history or more. This nation has governed by Buddhist, Hindus, Muslim and British. There have a golden history of its past.

	<center><h2>Somapura Mahavira at Naogaon</h2></center>
		<center><img src="images\paharpur.jpg" /></center>  
			<p>This place is also known as ‘Paharpur Mahavihar’ which is known for its grandeur monastery. This monastery was built during the Pala period. This is nominated as UNESCO World Heritage.
			This monastery has a top position in world history for its polished and gigantic architectural work. Each side of the monastery measures 900ft in length and is constructed of monk’s cells. There are 172 such cells and 92 altars of worship. There is a courtyard inside that containing the remains of the ancient Buddhist stupa. This is amongst those few monasteries that has survived the Muslim invasion.
			The enormous quadrangular structure stands with pride, and remains a heritage site for the visitors of Bangladesh.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this central structure at the midst of the courtyard remains unsolved since its discovery. Hence, most of the debates generated hitherto on the architecture of Sompur Mahavihara are cantered on the identification its missing superstructure. The reason may be manifold, but the most important one is the non-availability of substantial amount of first-hand resource including a comprehensive architectural documentation at the disposal of the researchers. There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara</p>
		<p>Consequently, most of works done so far are mainly based on the findings of the archaeological excavation and studying the artefacts from the archaeological perspective. The first study on this monument with documentation was by archaeologist K.N. Dikhist in his Paharpur, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey in India (1938). Dikhsit was concerned with documentation of the archaeological findings and concentrated on their interpretation and analysis. He attempted to suggest a probable architectural treatment of the missing parts of the structure through studying the archaeological remains. Till today, this study is considered as the most authentic record of the Sompur Mahavihara.</p>
			<p>he second work was published around thirty years after Myer's proposition. A team of architects[note 1] from Khulna University led by Mohammed Ali Naqi has proposed another theoretical reconstruction of the central structure as well as some parts of the peripheral block (mainly the entrance hall) in 1999. This work was also presented in the "International Seminar on Elaboration of an Archaeological Research Strategy for Paharpur World Heritage Site and Its Environment" jointly organised by UNESCO and Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh in 2004. Muhammad Ali Naqi proposed a temple-like spire at the top by considering the central mound as a 'Stupa-Shrine' with a 'Shikhara' type stupa in his reconstruction.</p>
				<h3>Somapura was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Since then, a series of UNESCO missions has regularly visited the site and helped with the project. Moreover, the UN body prepared a master plan, involving US$5.6 million</h3>
