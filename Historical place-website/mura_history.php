		<h2> History </h2>
		<p>Kotila Mura is an important Buddhist site in Bangladesh, one of fifty such sites amongst the Mainimati ruins. 

		Made up of three stupas, Kotila Mura is believed to have been in use from the seventh to the thirteenth centuries. Of these three Buddhist shrines, each represents one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism, being Dharma, Sangha and Buddha.<p>The suburb known today as Marsfield was formed from the Field of Mars Common, an area of 5050 acres (2044 hectares) declared in 1804 by Governor King as one of six ‘commons’ in the Colony, to be used for the grazing of livestock by local residents. The Common followed the path of the Lane Cove River and consisted mainly of heavily timbered bush. By the 1840s the area was notorious as the haunt of unsavory society, home to a range of activities such as gambling, sly grog selling and a range of antisocial activities. Following many years of community agitation and debate including a Parliamentary Select Committee, by 1874 the Common was formally resumed to allow sale and settlement by small farmers. The money raised was to be used to fund the crossings of the Parramatta River at Gladesville and Iron Cove, both of which were being demanded by the residents of the Ryde area. </p>
		<p>A regular grid pattern of streets was laid out and the land subdivided into small farms of between 0.4 and 1.6ha, with areas reserved for open space and special purposes. The street names chosen continued the martial tradition of the "Field of Mars" and referenced famous battles and British victories. The land itself was released for sale in stages, with the first being in the east Ryde area in 1885. A considerable proportion of purchasers bought multiple lots, paving the way for later re-subdivision. </p>
		<p>This is one of the sacred Buddhist places and one of the fifth spots amongst the Mainamati ruins. This is believed to be done on 600 AD. Kotila Mura is situated in Comilla, Bangladesh.

			This old historic place is situated on a flattened hillock and has three structures of Buddhist stupas. The three shrines are believed to be the three jewels of Buddhism, the Dharma, Sangha, and the Buddha. The only way to the shrine is through the east, a gateway which leads to a huge hall. This authentic Buddhist structure was active from the seventh century to the thirteenth century.

			It has a nearby place to visit, the Shalbanvihar which is also a Buddhist place, one amongst the Mainamati ruins.</p>
