				<h2>Physical description:</h2>	<p>Curzon Hall is a large sandstone mansion in an eclectic Federation Free style,, constructed from 1897 and completed in 1899. The building is on a north-east to south-west axis facing south-west. It is constructed of rusticated stonework with dressed stone trim, coursing and quoining. The façade is 2 storeys and symmetrical, with Victorian Italianate style colonnades with semi-circular arches on both levels, returning around both sides, below a sandstone parapet which matches the balustrading to both levels. The classical style parapet and balustrades feature sandstone posts with sandstone balusters. A central three-storey tower rises over the main door behind the port corchere facing Agincourt Road. The tower has a Roman bath window and above triple Gothic lancets surmounted by triple small circular windows with foiled tracery. Flanking the steps on the west side are pilasters with classical niches and diminutive pediments. The hipped roof line with gabled attic dormer windows is visible, along with tall sandstone chimneys, beyond the parapet. The roof is hipped at the rear. The roof is clad in slate with terracotta ridge capping. 

				To the east and north-east of the house are extensive modern additions, which are single storey to the Balaclava Road frontage. Vehicle access is available from both Balaclava Road and Agincourt Road, however the main access is from Agincourt Road to the west.
