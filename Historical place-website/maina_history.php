		<h2> History </h2>
		<p>Mainamati is located almost 8 miles from the town of Comilla, Bangladesh. It is the home of one of the most important Buddhist archaeological sites in the region. There are a number of Buddhist sites in this region, dating approximately from 7th to 12th centuries. Comilla Cantonment is located nearby and houses a beautiful colonial era cemetery. In fact, itâ€™s an isolated ridge of low hills in the eastern margins of deltaic Bangladesh; about 8 km to the west of Comilla town is a very familiar name in our cultural heritage, where archaeological excavations have revealed very significant materials. A landmark of our ancient history, it represents a small mass of quasi-lateritic old alluvium. The ridge, set in the vast expanse of the fertile lower Meghna basin, extends for about 17 km north-south from Mainamati village on the Gumti River to Chandi Mura near the Lalmai railway station. In its widest parts, the ridge is about 4.5 km across and its highest peaks attain a height of about 45 meters. 
</p>
		<p>Mainamati is named for the Candra queen of the same name, mother of the Govindachandra Buddhist monuments. The Mainamati ruins were rediscovered during the Second World War. While setting up an advance camp, the military came across ancient remains at a number of points in the ridge. In the hurried survey that followed, 18 sites were recognized and protected by the government. In more regular and systematic surveys undertaken between 1955 and 1957, when the entire ridge was undisturbed by human occupation, more than 50 sites were located. Most of those sites lie in the northern half of the ridge, now within the Cantonment. Mainamati is a famous Buddhist archaeological site. Marks of rich ancient civilization have been found in Lalmai Mainamati hills. In these hills there are plenty of archaeological sites. The Mainamati Museum is a prominent tourist attraction. Poet Rabindranath Tagore and Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi visited Comilla in 1921. The centre piece of the Buddhist sites at Mainamati is the Shalban Vihara, almost in the middle of the Mainamati-Lalmai hill range. It is clearly a Vihara, or an educational centre with residential facilities.

		<p>It consists of 115 cells, built around a spacious courtyard with a cruciform temple in the centre, facing its only gateway complex to the north, resembling that of the Sompur Bihara. Kutila Mura situated on a plateau. About 5 kilometers north of Salban Vihara is another important Buddhist establishment. Here, three stupas are found side by side representing the Buddhist "Trinity" or three jewels, i.e. the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Charpatra Mura is another 2.5 km. north-west of Kutila Mura stupas. Here a number of shrines can be found. The Mainamati site Museum, situated next to Salvan Bihara, houses a good collection of artifacts found at these sites.>
