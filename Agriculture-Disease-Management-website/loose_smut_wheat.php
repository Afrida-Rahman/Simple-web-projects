<h2>Symptoms and Signs</h2>
<p>Every ear of the affected plants is
converted into a black mass of spores
and no grains are formed. The
infected heads emerge from the boot
one to three days earlier than those of
healthy plants. As a rule, all the
glumes (chaff) and grain in a smutted
head are completely transformed into
black powder.

This sooty mass is composed almost entirely of millions of
teliospores. The spores are quickly dispersed by the wind
during the flowering period of normal heads, and by harvest
only an erect bare rachis remains. All of the floral parts of
the head, except for the rachis and pericarp membrane, are
invaded by mycelium of the fungus and converted into loose
aggregates of smut spores (teliospores).</p><br>
<h2>Predisposing Factors</h2>
<p>Wind<br>
• Moderate rains<br>
• Cool temperatures (16-22
degrees Celsius)</p><br>
<h2>Management of Loose Smut of Wheat</h2>
<p>• Disease control:<br>
The disease is internally seed borne and as such spray of
fungicides is not effective in controlling the disease.<br>
• Seed treatment<br>
• Use of resistant varieties:<br>
The most successful method is the use of resistant varieties.<br>
• Crop rotation:<br>
Crop rotation at suitable intervals is also effective in disease
control<br>

<h3>Seed treatment</h3><p>
(a) Hot water treatment:<br>
The seeds are first soaked in water for five hours at 20˚C , the
water is drained off and then they are treated with hot water
at 49˚C for about a minute and finally with hot water at 52˚C
for 11 minutes. Immediately after the hot water treatment ,
the seeds are cooled off by dipping in cold water and dried.
The dormant mycelium inside the seed dies off by this
treatment.<br><br>
(b) Use of systemic fungicides:<br>
Several fungicides like carboxin, vitavax and benlate @ 2.0
g/Kg seed and Propioconazole @ 0.1% are used for seed
treatment to reduce the pathogen infectivity. A combination
of vitavax with thiram is very effective for disease control.</p><br>
